Pre-req: Assuming we have ELF/exe file for borring.c. Assuming name to "borring" (gcc o borring borring.c; gcc borring.c -o borring)

YUM install:
yum install rpm-build

as a normal user:
1. create rpmbuild director at "/home/build/" by using command "rpmdev-setuptree" 
     ls -Ral /home/build/rpmbuild
2. create director borring-1.0
     mkdir /tmp/borring-1.0
3. create a c program & make file out of it
4. Check if makefile works. After testing delete exe "borring" (not mandatory)
5. Create a spec file in /tmp/borring-1.0/borring.spec
6. Generate a gun zip file out of  /tmp/borring-1.0
     tar -czvf borring1.0.tar.gz /tmp/borring-1.0
8. copy "borring1.0.tar.gz" to rpmbuild/SOURCES
     cp borring1.0.tar.gz /home/prod/rpmbuild/SOURCES
9. Run spec file now. 
     rpmbuild -ba 	/tmp/borring-1.0/borring.spec
10. if everything goes smooth you should see a rpm under "/home/build/rpmbuild/RPMS/i686"	 
11. by root user install rpm 
      rpm -i borring-1.0-1.el6.i686.rpm
12. Validate by installtion running "borring" command
13. After all done, clean up time. Remove borring from machine
      rpm -e borring
